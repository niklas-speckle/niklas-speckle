## Setup - Notes ##

Setup the Computer to flash Arduino: 

Install VS Code for your OS: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows

Install PlatformIO IDE Extension for VS Code:

Open Extensions View:

In VS Code, click on the Extensions icon on the sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+X (macOS).
Search for PlatformIO IDE:

In the Extensions view, type "PlatformIO IDE" in the search bar.
Install PlatformIO IDE:

Click the Install button next to the PlatformIO IDE extension.

Clone the Git responsetory in your prefered Diretory:

https: https://git.uibk.ac.at/informatik/qe/swess24/group4/g4t2.git
ssh: git@git.uibk.ac.at:informatik/qe/swess24/group4/g4t2.git

Open the PlatformIO IDE Extension in VS Code:

Select "Pick a folder" to open an existing Project. 

Select the following sub folder from the cloned responsetory: 

g4t2\hardware\temperaStation\src_arduino\nano

Replace the TD-ID Number located at line 8 in the "main.cpp" file, which is located in the "src" folder.

The ID needs to have this type: "group-TD-z"

group is replaced by your company shortcut or here per default with G4T2
z is replaced with the ID of the TD given by the web-App for example: 1 

example -> line 8: char id[] = "G4T2-TD-1";

Click on the PlatformIO Extension symbol:

PROJECT TASK->nano33ble->General->Upload 

or: select environment (nano33ble) in bottom toolbar (symbol with folder icon - PlatformIO project environment) and then upload
    via the rightarrow on bottom toolbar.

Don't forget to plug your Arduino in a com USB port before trying to upload (watch out not every usb cable is working for upload)

For Debugging: 

Etablish a Serial connection between your Computer and the TD with an USB-Kabel. 
Its important to checkt that the cabel is able to transmit data and not only Voltage.

Read the Data from the serial connection with the help of the inbuild Serial Monitor from PlatformIO:
 Therefore open a Terminal in VS Code and select in the top row Serial Monitor.

As an alternative you can use Putty to read and write Serial data: https://www.putty.org/
