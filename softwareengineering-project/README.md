## :bulb: Project Overview

Tempera is a smart device installed at the employee's desk, which:
- records working hours and working status at the push of a button,
- displays the current working mode (e.g., deep work, meeting),
- continuously measures the indoor climate (temperature, humidity, etc.).

The device communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with a Raspberry Pi (Access Point), which collects the data and forwards it via a REST API to a central backend. A web application provides a user-friendly interface for managing, visualizing, and analyzing the data.

A detailed project description is available here: [Project Description (PDF)](artefacts/Projektidee.pdf)

## :clipboard: Architecture Overview

![](artefacts/architekturuebersicht.jpg)

## :sparkles: Main Features

- **Status Switching via Button:** Four working modes (Present, Meeting, Deep Work, Out-of-Office) can be selected directly on the device.
- **Status Display:** The current working mode is shown via LED on the device and in the web application.
- **Indoor Climate Monitoring:** Continuous measurement of environmental conditions (e.g., humidity, light intensity).
- **Notifications:** Email and in-app alerts when climate thresholds are exceeded.
- **Time Tracking & Project Assignment:** Manage and correct time logs via the web application.
- **Device & User Management:** Central management of Tempera devices and access points, and their assignment to users.
- **Data Visualization:** Clear diagrams show working patterns and environmental data.
- **Team Overview:** Team leads can view activities of their team members.
