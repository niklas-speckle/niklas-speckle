# :information_desk_person: About Me

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have followed a path that combines statistical analysis, software development, and healthcare. My interest in programming and statistics was first sparked during my time as a student assistant at the Department of Statistics. This experience led me to specialize in programming and statistics whenever possible by choosing relevant electives throughout my studies. Fascinated by the power of data to uncover insights, I initially pursued a Master's degree in Data Science. However, I soon realized that I was missing the human and health-related aspects that had always been central to my interests. As a result, I decided to combine psychology and computer science, which allowed me to combine my passion for healthcare with my enthusiasm for software development and data analysis.
